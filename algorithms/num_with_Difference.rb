# Example: Given an array of distinct integer values, count the number of pairs
# of integers that have difference k.
# For example, given the array {1,7,5,9,2,12,13} and the diffference k=2,
# there are four pairs with difference 2.

# Brute force is comparing everything as you go through, while smarter would be to store comparisons youve already done.
