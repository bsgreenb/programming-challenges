# The hash data structure derives itâ€™s name from this hashing mechanism. Ruby
# uses the murmur hash function and then applies the division method with a prime number M, which Ruby determines based on the table size that is needed for storage.
# murmur_hash(key) % M

# In case two keys return the same number, also known as a hash collision, the value is chained on to the same location or bucket in the table.
# One interesting thing to note is hashes are unique for each Ruby process. The murmur hash seeds it with a random value, which results in a different hash for a particular key for each Ruby process.

# Starting with Ruby 1.9.3, a property of the hash is that the keys are ordered based on how they are inserted into the hash.  This is nice for example in keyword argumemnts.
